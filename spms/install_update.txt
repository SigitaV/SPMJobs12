
Note that if you download a full version of SPM (through the web form),
these updates will already have been incorporated in the spm*.zip archive.

so maybe always download the full package, which is easier.

===========================================================
just unpack the update archive over your SPM installation so that newer files overwrite existing files. (merge folders)

http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm*/#Updates

ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm*_updates

A MATLAB script (spm_update.m) is available to detect when a new SPM8 update is available, and possibly install it automatically.

The command line syntax to install the updates on Unix systems (Linux, Mac) is:

unzip spm*.zip
unzip -o spm*_updates_rxxxx.zip -d spm*
